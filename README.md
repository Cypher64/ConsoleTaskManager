# OOP Coursework

This project is designed as an OOP coursework to better understand the concepts and explore abstractions in more depth. It is just a console application that allows you to track and schedule some tasks. For training purposes, we had to bind a mysql database in order to store data about notes and users, whose passwords are hashed using the openssl library and the SHA1 algorithm.

The user of this application can use the following functions:
- Edit your profile
- Create task
- View list of task
- Sort task by status or by priority
- Edit tasks
To use this application, simply copy the repository and run the .exe (the Linux version will be available later and in a separate branche)
```
git clone https://github.com/Cypher64/ConsoleTaskManager.git
